Why comment lie?
Being agile programmers, we keep updating code, but no one really updates the comments. Hence they go outdated quickly.

Then how to explain code better?
Well, write better code! That's it! Ruby makes it easy for devs to write english like code which can make it highly readable.

So what is self documenting code?

A block of code explains itself without a need for a comment.
We add comments only if there is a complex scenario.
But mort of the time, write a good test for this complex scenario, which would make it better


Wait, no comments? That seems odd. When do we write comments anyway?
If we have a weird business reason for to write the code, maybe then we comment.
Another reason is, if we hardcode anything, it's good to have comments to explain them.
