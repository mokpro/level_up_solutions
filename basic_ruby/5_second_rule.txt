What is 5 second rule of review?

I guess anyone new should be able to say what does a method do with just 5 second of reading time.
This means we developers have to write code which follows following limits =>

- 100 lines for a class
- 5 lines for a method
- max 2 indents, if you need more, then move to a method
- 80 chars per line
