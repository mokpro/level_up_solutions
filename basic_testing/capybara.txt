For what type of tests do we use Capybara?
Helpful to test the app from browser perspective. We can simulate all the clicks and the links and follow all paths.
The weakness would be in handling race conditions due to ajax requests and other concurrent processing.

What are drivers?
It's like a plugin used by Capybara. Default drivers are I think well supported and are faster.
Optional drivers like javascript drivers are used when there is a need for it.
