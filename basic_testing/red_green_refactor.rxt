How Red-Green-Refactor makes code better?

Firstly, I learnt that tests aren't really test, they are specs. They define how the systems should work.

This is how we need to code:
  - Red: write test without the actual system codes so they fail
  - Green: write code so that these tests pass.
  - Refactor: Now it's yet another DRY day, since you are at work!


Some Gyaan in writing tests: Given, When, and Then pattern

Given that One Ring ring is linked to Sauron
When Frodo drops the ring into Mount Doom
Then the eye of Sauron would be destroyed.
