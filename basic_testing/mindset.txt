Why not to trust a developer?
Well, they are basically humans, so it is hard to write flawless, bug free code!
Also, developers are focus to get their part of the job done while testers generally have a bigger picuture.

Pitfalls to watch for?
- Report all the bugs, even if it's minor.
- Test against facts or requirements, not the ssumptions.

Why we should not be satisfied with testing our own code?
Writing unit and integration test is useful and important. But this does not end here.
We need to test the usability and other standards test for making it the product better.
